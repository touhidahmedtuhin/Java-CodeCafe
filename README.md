# Learning Java

Welcome to my Java learning repository! This project is a collection of code snippets and small applications that I'm building daily to practice and improve my Java skills.

### 🚀 Daily Practice

This section will be updated daily with links to the code for that day's practice session.

* **Day 1: Hello World**

* **Day 2: Variables and Data Types**

* **Day 3: Control Flow (if-else, switch)**

* **Day 4: Loops (for, while)**

* **Day 5: Arrays**

* **Day 6: Methods**

The code is organized by date to make it easy to follow my progress.
